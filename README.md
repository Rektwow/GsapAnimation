# Banner Animation Project with GSAP

## Overview

This repository contains a banner animation project created using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). 
GSAP is a powerful JavaScript animation library that allows for smooth and highly customizable animations on the web. 
In this project, I leveraged GSAP to create an eye-catching banner animation that can be used on websites or web applications to capture user attention and convey important information.

### FONTS

When using the Inspector in https://www.audible.de/ you can see that the used font is called "Audible Sans"
(font-family: "Audible Sans", Arial, sans-serif)

Unfortunately after hour long searching the closest fonts found were ("Amazon Ember" and "Bookerly") which are from the mother company of Audible aka https://www.amazon.de/ 
in the link below you can find the fonts.

Another search lead me to https://positype.com/custom/audible-sans
Initially thought I had found an applicable font, however it turned out to be nothing more than an image displaying examples of the font
(See Audible-Sans-specimen.jpeg in images folder)

In the end after many an unsuccessful research, I've settled for the backup font used by Audible which is "Arial".
