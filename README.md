###FONTS

When using the Inspector in https://www.audible.de/ you can see that the used font is called "Audible Sans"
(font-family: "Audible Sans", Arial, sans-serif)

Unfortunately after hour long searching the closest fonts found were ("Amazon Ember" and "Bookerly") which are from the mother company of Audible aka https://www.amazon.de/ 
in the link below you can find the fonts.
https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/branding/echo-guidelines/identity-guidelines/typography

Another search lead me to https://positype.com/custom/audible-sans
Initially thought I had found an applicable font, however it turned out to be nothing more than an image displaying examples of the font
(See Audible-Sans-specimen.jpeg in images folder)

In the end after many an unsuccessful research, I've settled for the backup font used by Audible which is "Arial".
